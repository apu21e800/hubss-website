## Pages to Build (in order)
1. Landing page — hero, products grid, applications, recent projects,
   lunch & learn CTA, footer
2. Projects page — filterable grid by product/application
3. Products page — each product with specs
4. Blog — MDX-powered, easy to add posts
5. Contact — form + both office locations

## Adding Content (no developer needed)
- New blog post: create /content/blog/post-name.mdx
- Swap hero image: replace /public/images/hero.jpg
- Add PDF spec sheet: drop in /public/docs/, update link in products page
- New project: add entry to /content/projects/project-name.mdx

## Conversion Goals
Primary CTA: "Request Spec Sheet" + "Book Lunch & Learn"
Secondary: Project gallery browsing → contact form
Lead capture: Name + Email + Phone (matches current form)
